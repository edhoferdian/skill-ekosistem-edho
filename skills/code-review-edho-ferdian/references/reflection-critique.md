# Reflection & Critique-Correction Protocols

Detailed reference for Phase 3 (Reflection / Refleksi Diri) and Phase 4
(Critique-Correction Loop / Dua Agen Saling Mengoreksi). These two passes exist
to attack the single biggest weakness of AI code review: **confident false
positives, inflated severity, and fixes that quietly change behavior.** A review
that survives both passes is one a maintainer can trust without redoing it.

---

## Phase 3 — Reflection (Refleksi Diri)

A structured self-audit of your own draft findings and fixes, run **before** the
user sees anything. Single-agent. Go finding by finding; be willing to delete
your own work.

### The six reflection gates

For **each finding**, pass it through these gates in order:

1. **Evidence gate.** Can I cite an exact location (line range, function,
   variable) and the specific token/pattern that proves the issue? If I'm
   pattern-matching to "code that looks like X usually has problem Y" without a
   concrete locus → **drop it**, or demote to ⚪ Info phrased as a question.

2. **False-positive gate.** Could this be correct or intentional in context I
   can't see? Examples: a "hardcoded value" that is a legitimate documented
   default; a "missing await" on a deliberately fire-and-forget call; a "magic
   number" that's a well-known constant. If a benign reading is plausible →
   **downgrade and state the assumption** ("flagged assuming X; if Y, ignore").

3. **Severity-calibration gate.** Is severity = real impact × exploitability/
   likelihood, or am I inflating to look thorough? A theoretical XSS on an
   admin-only, authenticated, internal field is not 🔴. Recalibrate honestly.
   Under-calling a real auth bypass is just as wrong as over-calling a style nit.

4. **Overlap gate.** Am I reporting one root cause as several findings (e.g.
   "no input validation" surfacing as five separate entries)? **Merge** into one
   finding with multiple locations.

5. **Intent-preservation gate.** Does my proposed fix change *observable
   behavior* (outputs, side effects, API contract, ordering)? Code review fixes
   implementation, not behavior, unless the user asked for a behavior change. If
   the fix would alter behavior → **revise the fix** to be behavior-preserving,
   or reclassify it as a "proposed behavior change — needs sign-off."

6. **Hallucination gate.** Am I asserting how a library/framework/API behaves,
   or that a function exists, without having verified it? → label
   **[needs verification]**, or actually verify it in Phase 2. Never state
   version-specific or time-sensitive behavior as settled fact.

### Output of Phase 3

A concise, auditable **Reflection Notes** block for the final report:

```
Reflection Notes
- Dropped CQ-xx (no concrete location — was a generic pattern guess).
- Downgraded SEC-yy 🔴→🟡 (exploit requires admin auth; impact limited).
- Merged PERF-aa + PERF-bb (same root cause: unbatched DB calls).
- Held PERF-cc at [Low — needs verification] (depends on prod data volume).
```

This block is not optional. It is the visible proof that the review was
self-corrected, and it tells the maintainer exactly where your confidence is thin.

### Why this works (don't skip it)

Self-critique reliably removes a meaningful share of spurious findings in review
tasks, because generation and verification are different cognitive modes — asking
"is this actually true?" surfaces errors that "find the problems" does not. The
cost is a few hundred tokens; the payoff is a report that doesn't cry wolf.

## Phase 4 — Critique-Correction Loop (Dua Agen)

An **adversarial** pass. Reflection is you checking yourself; this is a second
role trying to *break* your work. The independence is the value — a critic whose
job is to disagree finds things a self-review rationalizes away.

### Roles

- **Reviewer (Agent A)** — owns the findings + fixes produced in Phases 1–3.
- **Critic (Agent B)** — owns the attack. B's mandate, in B's own words:
  > "Treat every finding as guilty until proven real. For each one, demand the
  > evidence; if A can't point to the exact code, it's a false positive — strike
  > it. For each fix: will it compile/run? Does it preserve behavior? Is it the
  > simplest correct fix, or over-engineered? Then hunt for what A **missed** —
  > especially security and performance issues that don't look like bugs. Finally,
  > re-check the report's claims against the actual code; flag any drift between
  > what the report says and what the code does."
- **Correction** — A responds to each of B's points: **accept** (revise the
  finding/fix) or **reject** (with a concrete reason). A then emits the revised
  set.

### Termination & guardrails (this part is mandatory)

Correction loops fail in two ways: they **oscillate** (A and B flip-flop) or they
**over-correct** (each round adds caveats until the output is mush). Bound it:

- **Max 2 rounds.** Hard cap.
- **Converge early.** If a round produces no material objection, stop — don't
  manufacture disagreement to fill the quota.
- **Materiality filter.** Only **correctness, security, and behavior** disputes
  justify a second round. Style/taste disagreements are logged, not looped on.
- **Disagreement is allowed to stand.** If A and B can't resolve a genuine
  technical dispute, **surface both positions to the user** with the tradeoff —
  don't force a fake resolution or average them into something neither believes.

### Implementation: real subagents vs role-play

- **With subagents (Claude Code `Task` tool):** spawn A and B as *separate*
  agents so B doesn't inherit A's rationalizations. This is the stronger setup.
  Give B only the code + A's report, and the critic mandate above. Cost: extra
  tokens/latency for genuine independence — usually worth it for pre-merge or
  security-sensitive reviews.
- **Without subagents:** role-play the two parts sequentially in one context.
  Less independent (you've seen A's reasoning), but still catches real errors if
  you commit to the adversarial stance. State which mode you used in the report.

### Output of Phase 4

One line in the report:

```
Critique-Correction: converged in 2 rounds via subagents.
  B struck CQ-zz (false positive), forced SEC-yy fix to preserve return type,
  added PERF-dd (missed N+1 in pagination). 1 unresolved dispute surfaced below.
```

…followed by any unresolved disputes, each as: the question, A's position,
B's position, and the tradeoff for the user to decide.

## How the two passes relate

Reflection (Phase 3) is cheap and always runs — it cleans up obvious
self-deception. Critique-Correction (Phase 4) is heavier and earns its cost on
**high-stakes reviews**: pre-merge to main/prod, security-sensitive code, or when
the user explicitly wants maximum rigor. For a quick sanity check on a throwaway
script, Phase 3 alone may suffice — say so and let the user opt into Phase 4
rather than burning tokens by default on low-stakes code.
